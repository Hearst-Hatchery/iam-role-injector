# iam-role-injector

The IAM Role Injector is a tool for easily assuming an IAM Role with
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). It manipulates environment variables
to allow codebases already using AWS credentials to use IAM roles with minimal to no
refactoring. In the same vein, the Role Injector can also be used to help users using the
command line tools to assume a role.

## Command Line Usage
```
source assume_role.sh {accountNumber} {mfaAccountNumber} {rolename} {username}
```

Calling the script with 'source' is required for the
environment variables to persist past the runtime of the script.

The script will also protect your original credentials if you chose to
store *them* as environment variables.
